✅ Control screen
✅ Control screen V2 (Without color and images, only text, but very fast and stable)
✅ Never killable (Except formatting the phone or some uninstall tools that we don't know.)
✅ Starts automatically when the device starts, if the permission not given, then spamming notification and open the app when go to sleep mode (on huawei and xiaomi too)
✅ Gets permissions automatically
✅ Add blank screen while controlling device
✅ Only consumes 60-100 mb ram and 6MB apk size
✅ Works on all android versions
✅ Restricted Settings bypass on android 13 (binded inside app)
✅ Execute shell commands WITH root (like set device-owner)
✅ Ransomware, add text on all images, documents etc.
✅ Show custom window top of all apps with html
✅ Keylogger, saves all things even if internet is closed
✅ Auto install if app is deleted somehow
✅ Binding to other apks
✅ Read SMS, Send SMS, Read all contacts- Send all contacts the same SMS, Hide sms- Notifications, Send notification (uses Firebase Service where its handy for making app alive) Vibrate, take selfie from front camera, listen for microphone, set wallpaper, call someone, get app list, delete or download new apps, show toast and etc..
✅ App uses different obfuscate technique, where most of antivirusses doesnt recognize the malware. Still its always better to FUD the apk.
✅ And other things which i don't remember xD
